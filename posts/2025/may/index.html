    <h2>Critical Illness Insurance in Ontario: Current Status and Trends</h2>
    <p>
      Critical illness insurance has become an increasingly important safety net for Ontario residents in recent years. Despite Ontario’s universal healthcare (OHIP), a serious illness like cancer or a heart attack can bring significant out-of-pocket costs and financial strain beyond what provincial health plans cover. This is where critical illness insurance comes in – it provides a <strong>tax-free lump-sum payment</strong> upon diagnosis of a covered serious illness, allowing patients to focus on recovery without worrying about money. First introduced in Canada about 30 years ago, critical illness insurance remains less familiar than life or disability insurance, but awareness is growing rapidly. In fact, <strong>over 2 million Canadians now have critical illness coverage</strong> through individual or group plans, and a significant portion of those insured are Ontario residents. Regulators like the <a href="https://www.fsrao.ca" target="_blank" class="tooltip" data-tooltip="FSRA - Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Ontario. Official insurance regulation details.">Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Ontario (FSRA)</a> ensure that insurers and agents selling these policies are properly licensed and follow Ontario insurance laws, giving consumers confidence that they are dealing with reputable providers.
    </p>
    
    <h3>What is Critical Illness Insurance?</h3>
    <p>
      Critical illness insurance (CII) is a type of <em>living benefit</em> insurance that pays you a one-time <strong>tax-free cash benefit</strong> if you’re diagnosed with a life-altering illness covered by your policy. Unlike health insurance that reimburses medical bills, a critical illness policy simply cuts you a cheque for the coverage amount after diagnosis (and survival of a waiting period, typically 30 days). You can use that money however you see fit. <strong>Covered illnesses</strong> usually include the “big three” – <strong>cancer, heart attack, and stroke</strong> – which account for the majority of claims, as well as other serious conditions like coronary bypass surgery, kidney failure, major organ transplant, multiple sclerosis, dementia (including Alzheimer’s), paralysis, blindness, deafness, and more. Most comprehensive plans in Ontario today cover <em>approximately 25 illnesses</em> (the exact list is defined in your contract). For example, a typical policy would pay if the insured suffers a life-threatening cancer, a significant heart event, or one of dozens of other listed critical conditions. Each policy clearly defines what counts – for instance, a cancer diagnosis usually must be of a specified severity (early non-life-threatening cancers might not trigger a full claim). However, modern policies often address this by providing <strong>partial payouts for early-stage cancers or less severe conditions</strong>, so that policyholders can still get a benefit for conditions that don’t meet the full definition of a critical illness. In all cases, the core idea is that if a serious illness strikes, the insurer pays you a lump sum cash benefit (which is <strong>non-taxable</strong>) that you are free to use as needed.
    </p>
    
    <h3>How the Tax-Free Lump Sum Helps Ontario Residents</h3>
    <p>
      The <strong>financial benefit</strong> from a critical illness policy offers tremendous flexibility and peace of mind during a health crisis. Once you receive your lump-sum payment, there are <em>no restrictions</em> on how you spend it – you can use it for any expense or need. In practice, Ontario residents typically use critical illness insurance payouts to cover costs and losses that OHIP or employer benefits might not fully address. Common uses of the funds include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Medical expenses not covered by OHIP:</strong> This could mean expensive prescription drugs, specialist treatments, or medical devices that your provincial health plan doesn’t pay for. For example, certain cancer medications, cutting-edge therapies, or rehabilitation programs may fall outside of government coverage or private health plans. The lump sum lets you afford these without draining your savings.</li>
      <li><strong>Travel and accommodation for treatment:</strong> If you need to travel to receive treatment (e.g. to a specialized cancer center or to another province/country for a procedure), the insurance money can fund airfare, gas, hotels, and even parking at the hospital. These costs can add up quickly for families in Ontario, especially if the best treatment option is far from home.</li>
      <li><strong>Replacing lost income and daily living expenses:</strong> Many people take an extended leave from work (or their spouse takes time off) to undergo treatment and recovery. The payout can act as an income replacement, helping you <em>pay the mortgage, rent, utility bills, and groceries</em> while you focus on getting better. This prevents a serious illness from snowballing into a financial crisis. It essentially serves a role similar to disability income protection, but as a lump sum that you manage yourself.</li>
      <li><strong>Home care and caregiving support:</strong> Recovery often requires help at home – you might need to hire a nurse, personal support worker, or childcare if a parent is ill. Critical illness benefits can fund <em>in-home nursing care, child care, or help with housework</em> during your convalescence. The goal is to maintain your quality of life and ease the burden on family members.</li>
      <li><strong>Home modifications or lifestyle adjustments:</strong> Some illnesses require you to make changes to your living environment or lifestyle. People may use the money to renovate a bathroom to be wheelchair-accessible, purchase mobility aids, or even pursue alternative therapies and wellness programs. Since the benefit is yours to use freely, it can cover <em>anything from nutritional supplements and therapy sessions to a recuperative family vacation</em> once treatment is over – whatever aids in recovery.</li>
      <li><strong>Protecting long-term finances:</strong> One often-overlooked use is that the lump sum can prevent you from depleting your retirement savings or incurring debt. For instance, rather than raiding an RRSP or taking on a second mortgage to pay medical bills, you can use the insurance proceeds, thereby <em>protecting your retirement nest egg</em> for the future. If the full amount isn’t needed for immediate expenses, some recipients even invest a portion of the payout for longer-term financial security.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Ontarians appreciate that these payouts are <strong>delivered tax-free</strong> (because insurance benefits in Canada are generally not taxed), so if your policy provides $100,000 in coverage, you get the full $100,000 in hand. This financial flexibility means critical illness insurance benefits can fill the gaps that neither government health insurance nor traditional health benefits cover, providing a buffer that lets you focus on healing. As <a href="https://www.canadalife.com" target="_blank" class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Canada Life - Consumer Information on Critical Illness Insurance.">Canada Life</a> summarizes: it’s <em>“a one-time tax-free payment you can use however you want – to cover costs your healthcare plan doesn’t, pay the bills, protect your retirement savings, or fund expensive drugs or alternative treatments”</em>.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Current Trends and Statistics in Critical Illness Coverage</h3>
    <p>
      In Ontario and across Canada, critical illness insurance has evolved from a niche product to a growing component of personal financial planning. Several <strong>trends and statistics</strong> highlight the current status of this coverage:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Rising Incidence of Critical Illness:</strong> Unfortunately, critical illnesses are common – which underscores the need for this insurance. For example, <strong>about 1 in 2 Canadians will develop cancer in their lifetime</strong>, and heart disease and stroke remain leading causes of death and disability. The good news is that survival rates for many illnesses have improved (over 60% of cancer patients now survive at least 5 years), meaning more people live through a serious illness – but then face the financial aftermath. This has made critical illness insurance more relevant than ever: it’s insurance not for if you die, but for if you <em>live</em> through a serious health scare and need support during recovery.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Growth in Popularity and Awareness:</strong> Over the last few years, more Ontarians have been buying critical illness policies, either individually or through workplace benefit plans. Industry data shows that <strong>sales of critical illness insurance surged in 2023</strong>, with annualized premiums up 12% compared to 2022 – the strongest growth in over a decade. The number of new policies sold in Canada also ticked up by about 4% in 2023 (rising from ~110,600 to ~114,900 policies) after several years of decline. This bump suggests a renewed awareness of health risks post-pandemic and greater willingness to invest in financial protection. In Ontario specifically, insurance advisors report increased inquiries about critical illness coverage as consumers realize that government health care doesn’t cover lost income or many ancillary costs of illness.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>More Canadians (and Ontarians) Covered:</strong> As mentioned, <strong>over two million Canadians</strong> now have some form of critical illness insurance, either via personal policies or group benefits. Ontario, being Canada’s largest province, represents a significant chunk of that figure. Still, there is room to grow – a 2022 FSRA consumer survey found only about 8% of respondents had <em>either</em> disability or critical illness insurance coverage, indicating many households remain vulnerable. The industry is making efforts to close this protection gap. In early 2024, the <a href="https://www.clhia.ca" target="_blank" class="tooltip" data-tooltip="CLHIA - Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association. Industry guide on critical illness insurance.">Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association (CLHIA)</a> even released a new <strong>consumer guide to critical illness insurance</strong> to educate the public on how the product works and its importance. This kind of outreach is geared toward Ontario consumers as well, aiming to demystify critical illness insurance which historically has been less understood than life insurance.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Group and Affinity Market Growth:</strong> Employers and professional associations are also embracing critical illness coverage. In Ontario, for example, the Ontario Medical Association recently switched insurers to offer an enhanced critical illness benefit to its physician members, reflecting growing acceptance of CII in group benefit programs. Many companies now offer critical illness insurance as an optional benefit that employees can buy at group rates, further expanding coverage across the province.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Claims Payouts Increasing:</strong> As more people hold policies, insurers have been paying out more in claims (often called “living benefits”). While specific Ontario-only data isn’t published, Canadian life and health insurers collectively paid out record benefit amounts in recent years (over $128 billion in various benefits in 2023 across life, health, disability, etc.). A portion of that is critical illness claims – providing families with much-needed financial relief. Insurers note that cancer is by far the top cause of critical illness claims (often well over half of all claims), followed by heart-related conditions and strokes. The growing volume of claims has also pushed insurers to improve their claims processes and support services (for example, some now offer claimants access to nurse advisors or second medical opinions as part of the policy).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Overall, the trend in Ontario is that <strong>critical illness insurance is moving into the mainstream</strong>. With higher take-up rates, insurers and regulators are focusing on customer education and fair treatment. Consumers are advised to carefully review what conditions are covered and any exclusions or waiting periods – but once they understand the value, many see critical illness insurance as an essential layer of financial protection in today’s environment.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Evolving Coverage and Policy Features in Recent Years</h3>
    <p>
      The critical illness insurance products available in Ontario have seen several <strong>notable changes and improvements</strong> in recent years. Insurers have been updating their policies to be more comprehensive and flexible, in response to medical advances and consumer needs:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Broader Illness Coverage:</strong> Early critical illness policies decades ago covered only a handful of illnesses (often the basic four: cancer, heart attack, stroke, and coronary bypass surgery). Today, most Ontario insurers cover <em>two dozen or more</em> conditions. For instance, <a href="https://www.desjardins.com/ca/insurance" target="_blank" class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Desjardins Insurance - Critical Illness Insurance Overview (Health Priorities).">Desjardins’s latest Health Priorities plan</a> covers <strong>26 critical illnesses and conditions</strong>, including all the common ones and some rarer conditions, making it <em>“one of the most inclusive in Canada”</em>. Sun Life’s enhanced critical illness plan similarly covers <strong>26 full-payout illnesses</strong> (such as life-threatening cancer, acquired brain injury, paralysis, etc.) and even includes coverage for certain childhood diseases. By contrast, many competitors used to cover 24 or 25 conditions – now the standard has shifted upward so that 25+ conditions is normal. This means conditions like <strong>Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s, major organ transplants, blindness, deafness, severe burns, aplastic anemia, and others</strong> are commonly covered across most leading insurers’ plans. Some policies also allow an extra illness to be added via rider – for example, Canada Life’s plan covers 25 illnesses by default but gives an option to include <strong>“loss of independent existence”</strong> as an additional covered condition for an extra premium.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Partial Payouts for Early-Stage Conditions:</strong> One of the biggest innovations has been the introduction of <strong>partial benefit payments</strong> for less severe diagnoses. Medical science now catches many illnesses at earlier stages – for example, a very early-stage cancer or a minor heart procedure. Rather than pay nothing in those cases, many policies will pay a percentage (often 10–25%) of the coverage as an “advance” while keeping the policy in force for future claims. For example, Desjardins’ plan will <strong>cover all types of cancer with partial or total payments as the illness progresses</strong>, meaning an early-stage cancer might trigger a partial payout, and if the cancer later becomes invasive, the rest of the benefit can still be claimed. Insurers commonly list specific “minor conditions” that pay partial benefits – e.g. non-life-threatening cancers like DCIS (early breast cancer) or Stage A prostate cancer, or procedures like angioplasty. Sun Life’s policy, for instance, includes <strong>8 minor illnesses</strong> (such as early cancers) eligible for a partial payout, and Manulife’s Lifecheque offers <strong>25% of the benefit (up to $50,000)</strong> for several defined early-stage conditions like early prostate cancer or angioplasty. These partial payouts do not usually reduce the full coverage for a <em>different</em> critical illness later, but some plans count them against the total for the same illness category. Overall, this feature ensures policyholders get some benefit even if their illness is caught early – aligning the insurance with modern preventative healthcare.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Coverage for Children’s Illnesses:</strong> Recognizing that critical illnesses can affect people at any age, many insurers now extend coverage or riders for <strong>children’s critical illnesses</strong>. In Ontario, some family policies automatically cover dependent children for certain conditions. Desjardins includes <strong>6 childhood illnesses or disabilities</strong> (like autism, cystic fibrosis, cerebral palsy, Type 1 diabetes) in its child coverage module. Sun Life’s policy covers <strong>five childhood conditions</strong> in its standard plan as well. This means if a child of the insured is diagnosed with one of those covered serious conditions, a lump sum is paid (sometimes a portion of the coverage, or a fixed amount). Parents often add child critical illness riders to help cover the costs of pediatric cancers or other severe illnesses that would require a parent to take time off work. This development has broadened the appeal of critical illness insurance for young families in Ontario.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Return of Premium and Other Riders:</strong> One common hesitation people have is, “What if I pay premiums for years and never get a critical illness – do I just lose that money?” To address this, insurers introduced <strong>Return of Premium (ROP)</strong> riders. These allow you to get back some or all of the premiums you paid if you <em>never</em> make a claim (typically available at a certain policy duration or age) or if you die without having claimed (in that case, premiums can be returned to your estate). Many Ontario plans now offer ROP options. For example, Sun Life’s critical illness insurance offers a <strong>return of premiums at age 75</strong> or upon death if no claim was made. Manulife and Canada Life likewise have ROP on expiry or death options. While these riders increase the cost, they guarantee you or your beneficiaries get something back even if you stay healthy, which some clients find attractive as a form of savings. It’s worth noting these are optional – you can keep premiums lower by opting out of ROP – but the availability of ROP has been a notable development to counter the “use it or lose it” concern.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Flexible Term Lengths and Multi-Claim Options:</strong> Critical illness insurance started primarily as a term product (often term-to-65, since the biggest risk period for critical illness is working years). Today, there is a lot more flexibility. In Ontario, you can buy <strong>term 10 or term 20 year coverage, coverage up to a specific age like 65 or 75, or even permanent lifetime critical illness insurance</strong> that covers you for life. Major providers (<a href="https://www.manulife.ca" target="_blank" class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Manulife - Lifecheque Critical Illness Insurance Details.">Manulife</a>, <a href="https://www.sunlife.ca" target="_blank" class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Sun Life - Critical Illness Insurance Coverage Details.">Sun Life</a>, <a href="https://www.canadalife.com" target="_blank" class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Canada Life - Consumer Information on Critical Illness Insurance.">Canada Life</a>, etc.) all offer these choices. Permanent critical illness (with limited-pay options like pay for 15 or 20 years and have coverage for life) has gained popularity for those who want lifelong protection (for instance, to cover long-term care expenses if they get Alzheimer’s in old age). Another recent feature from at least one insurer is <strong>second-event coverage</strong> – Canada Life now allows an option where if you claim for one critical illness, you can still be covered for a different unrelated critical illness in the future (typically with a reduced benefit for the second event). Most policies traditionally terminate after one claim (since they are “one-and-done” coverage), but this second event rider is an innovation for additional peace of mind. Not all companies offer it (Desjardins and Manulife do not – the policy ends after the full payout), so this is a differentiator to be aware of.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Simplified and Basic Plans:</strong> Alongside comprehensive plans, insurers have also rolled out <strong>simplified critical illness products</strong> to cater to those seeking more affordable, no-frills coverage. For example, some companies offer a stripped-down policy covering only the 3 most common illnesses (cancer, heart attack, stroke) at a lower premium. RBC Insurance’s “Critical Illness Recovery Plan” is one such offering that <em>“provides coverage for the three most common critical illnesses – cancer, heart attack and stroke”</em>. Manulife’s Lifecheque Basic similarly covers a limited set of five illnesses (the big three plus a couple others like coronary bypass and maybe one more). These basic plans often have simpler underwriting (or even no medical tests up to certain limits) and can be easier to get if you have minor health issues. The trade-off is fewer conditions covered and sometimes lower benefit options. Still, they represent a recent development to make critical illness insurance accessible to more people who might not want or need the full suite of coverage.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      All of these changes – more illnesses covered, partial payouts, child coverage, flexible terms, money-back options – indicate an <strong>ever-improving landscape for critical illness insurance</strong>. Ontario consumers in 2025 have a variety of choices and can tailor coverage to their needs and budget. It’s wise to compare policies and consult with a licensed insurance advisor to understand which features matter most for your situation. The positive aspect is that competition among insurers has led to more robust coverage and customer-friendly features than were available even a decade ago.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Comparing Major Critical Illness Insurance Providers in Ontario</h3>
    <p>
      Ontario is served by all the major Canadian life and health insurers, many of whom offer critical illness insurance. Let’s take a look at how some of the <strong>leading providers’</strong> critical illness plans stack up, particularly focusing on Manulife, Sun Life, Canada Life, and Desjardins – four big names in this space. While each company’s product has its nuances, all are reputable insurers and their offerings share more similarities than differences. Below is a comparison of key features:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Manulife (Lifecheque®):</strong> Manulife’s flagship critical illness plan covers <strong>25 full-payout illnesses</strong> (the standard list of covered conditions) and additionally provides partial payments for <strong>6 early-stage conditions</strong> (25% of the benefit, up to $50,000) such as early-stage cancers. The maximum coverage amount available is <strong>$2 million</strong> for an individual policy. Manulife offers multiple term options – you can choose a 10-year term, 20-year term, coverage up to age 65 or 75, or even a lifelong plan. Lifecheque also has optional riders like Return of Premium (on death or expiry) and a rider to cover your children. A unique aspect is Manulife’s handling of <strong>“Loss of Independent Existence”</strong> (the inability to perform activities of daily living) – instead of a lump sum, Lifecheque provides a monthly benefit if that condition occurs. In summary, Manulife’s plan is very comprehensive and backed by one of Canada’s largest insurers. It’s often chosen for its flexibility and the financial strength of the company.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sun Life:</strong> Sun Life Financial is another top provider in Ontario. Its critical illness insurance has an “enhanced” version that covers <strong>26 critical illnesses</strong> for a full payout – this includes all the typical conditions plus things like acquired brain injury and loss of independent existence (Sun Life includes those in the 26). In addition, Sun Life covers <strong>8 minor illnesses</strong> with a partial benefit (for example, non life-threatening cancers, certain less critical conditions). Sun Life’s policy also automatically covers <strong>5 childhood illnesses</strong> (such as cystic fibrosis, congenital heart disease, etc.) for any insured children, which can be a valuable perk for families. Coverage amounts can go into the millions (Sun Life typically offers up to at least $2 million or more – comparable to other big insurers’ limits). Available term lengths include 10-year renewable term, term to age 75, and permanent coverage options. Sun Life also offers return of premium options (e.g., get premiums back at age 75 or on death if you never had a claim). The Sun Life plan is often praised for its <strong>comprehensive feature set</strong> – it has one of the highest counts of covered conditions (tied with Desjardins) and robust optional benefits. Many Ontario consumers also appreciate Sun Life’s longstanding presence (it’s a very familiar brand) and its large advisor network for support.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Canada Life (LifeAdvance™):</strong> Canada Life’s critical illness product (sometimes referred to as LifeAdvance) is known as the “Cadillac” or “Rolls Royce” of coverage for its breadth – and it also allows one of the largest coverage amounts. Canada Life offers up to <strong>$3 million</strong> in critical illness coverage for an individual, one of the highest limits in the industry. It covers <strong>25 critical illnesses</strong> by default, with an option to add a 26th (the loss of independent existence rider) if desired. Like its peers, it includes partial payouts for <strong>8 early-stage conditions</strong> (up to $50k each) to ensure smaller illnesses or procedures are covered. Canada Life provides a wide range of term options: 10-year term, 20-year term, to age 75, and also <strong>permanent coverage with limited-pay options</strong> (you can pay off the policy in 15 or 20 years, for example, and then have lifetime protection). Notably, Canada Life also offers a <strong>second-event benefit</strong> rider – so you could potentially claim twice (for two different illnesses) if you paid for that feature. As with others, return of premium and child coverage riders are available. Canada Life’s plan is very customizable and is often considered when clients want <em>maximum</em> coverage or specific riders. The trade-off is it can be priced a bit higher for all those “bells and whistles”. Still, its reputation for comprehensive coverage makes it a top choice, especially for those who “don’t want to spare any expense” in protecting themselves.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Desjardins (Health Priorities):</strong> Desjardins Insurance’s critical illness plan has garnered attention for setting a <strong>new standard of coverage inclusivity</strong>. It covers <strong>26 full-payout illnesses</strong> – currently the highest number of covered conditions among major insurers, encompassing virtually every critical illness defined by the industry. Additionally, Desjardins offers an exceptionally broad range of <strong>16 conditions eligible for partial payouts</strong>, more than most competitors, which includes various early-stage cancers and minor conditions across different illness categories. The maximum benefit available is <strong>$3,000,000</strong> per policy, putting it on par with Canada Life for high coverage limits. Desjardins Health Priorities can be purchased as a term 10, term 20, term to age 65 or 75, or as permanent coverage, giving flexibility similar to others. A distinguishing feature is that <strong>coverage for children’s illnesses is built-in</strong> – their plan automatically covers 6 childhood diseases/disabilities (like autism, Type 1 diabetes, muscular dystrophy, etc. as listed earlier) at no extra charge. Desjardins also generally has <em>no survival period</em> for most illnesses (meaning the lump sum pays out upon diagnosis without requiring the insured to survive 30 days, except for certain heart conditions) – this can be seen as an advantage in some scenarios. The product also offers return of premium options on cancellation or death. In summary, Desjardins has positioned its critical illness insurance as a <strong>market leader in coverage breadth</strong>, which appeals to those who want the <em>widest</em> net of protection (26 conditions) and generous partial benefits. Being a large Canadian insurer (and dominant in Quebec, though fully active in Ontario too), Desjardins brings a mutual/cooperative ethos that some clients trust. Advisors often recommend it for clients who want the <em>widest</em> net of protection and generous partial benefits.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      When comparing providers, Ontario consumers should consider factors like: <em>How many illnesses are covered? What’s the maximum payout? Are partial (early stage) claims offered? What optional riders (like ROP or second-event) are available?</em> as well as cost differences. It’s also wise to read the definitions of key illnesses in the policy – while most insurers follow standard definitions (often based on guidelines from the industry association), there can be minor variations. The good news is all major insurers in Canada are stable and well-regulated, so the choice often comes down to finding the right mix of coverage and price for your needs. It can be helpful to speak with a licensed insurance advisor or broker who works with multiple companies to get personalized recommendations.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      In Ontario, critical illness insurance has emerged as a <strong>critical component of financial planning</strong>, bridging the gap between health care and financial security. The current state of critical illness insurance in the province is one of increasing adoption, expanding coverage, and product innovation. With high odds of facing a serious illness (nearly half of us will face one like cancer in our lifetime) and with more people surviving these illnesses than ever before, having a financial cushion in place makes a world of difference. The tax-free lump sum payout from a critical illness policy provides <strong>freedom and flexibility</strong> at a time when you need it most, whether that means keeping up with bills, accessing world-class treatment, or simply taking the time to recover without economic anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ontario residents looking into critical illness insurance should stay informed about the latest policy features and compare offerings from various providers. All the major insurers – Manulife, Sun Life, Canada Life, Desjardins, and others – are competing to offer robust coverage, which benefits consumers.
